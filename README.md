**Responsive Background Image Formatter**

Beta version...

This module enables a new display formatter for applying a responsive background image using the B-Lazy js plugin.

At the moment you have to select 3 image sizes and these are mapped to preset breakpoints based on the Twitter Bootstrap convention. Later the plan is to expand this to hook into the Drupal breakpoint features.
